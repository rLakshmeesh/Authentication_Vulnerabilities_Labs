# Authentication Vulnerabilities Labs

This repository contains detailed documentation of labs focused on **authentication-related vulnerabilities** from **portswigger**
Each lab is analyzed and documented to provide a structured learning path for understanding, exploiting and mitigating authentication flaws in web applications. This documentation will also consist of multiple methods to approach the result using linux tools and many. So this repository will help in start learn ethical hacking from basic and also methods to avoid it.
This repository will also consist of a weekly report that will be professional report based posted every weekend. These process will help use in practicing documentation process as well.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

Each lab writeup will include the following sections:

1. **Lab Title & Vulnerability Type**  
   - Clear name of the lab and the type of authentication flaw.

2. **OWASP Top 10 Mapping**  
   - The relevant OWASP category that the vulnerability falls under.

3. **Description**  
   - Overview of the vulnerability and why it exists.

4. **Tools Used**  
   - Tools leveraged to exploit the issue (e.g., Burp Suite, Hydra).

5. **Attack Path Diagram**  
   - A simple flow diagram showing how the attack works from start to impact.

6. **Step-by-Step Exploitation**  
   - Detailed instructions on how the vulnerability can be reproduced and exploited.

7. **Result**  
   - The outcome of the attack (e.g., valid credentials obtained, successful login).

8. **Mitigation**  
   - Security measures and best practices to prevent the vulnerability.

9. **Real-World Relevance**  
   - How attackers exploit this in real-world applications and its potential impact.

## üéØ Goal
- To build a **collection of authentication vulnerability labs** with detailed documentation.  
- To help learners and professionals understand how authentication flaws can be exploited and secured.  
- To align learnings with the **OWASP Top 10** framework.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
These labs are performed in **legal and controlled environments** (e.g., PortSwigger Web Security Academy or DVWA).  
Do **not** attempt these techniques on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
Mainly the things that include tools like **hydra in kali** is strictly need an explicit permission to carry the attack on the desired website. In this documentation its been only shown theoriticaly and not practiced on any website its only for educational purpose.
