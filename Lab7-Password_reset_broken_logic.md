# Lab 7: Password reset brocken logic

## Vulnerability Type
  - Broken Password Reset Functionality
  - Improper Validation of Password Reset Token
  - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)-like issue (because attacker can change the username and reset another userâ€™s password).

## Description
In this lab, the application implements a flawed password reset mechanism.  
When a user initiates a password reset, the server issues a temporary token (`temp-forgot-password-token`) which is included in both the **URL** and the **request body**.  

However, the application fails to properly validate that this token is strictly tied to the requesting account.  
By intercepting the request and modifying the **username field** to that of a victim, while keeping or tampering with the token, an attacker can successfully reset another userâ€™s password.  

This results in an HTTP **302 Found** response indicating the reset was accepted.  
The attacker can then log in to the victimâ€™s account using the newly set password.

## Tools Used
- **Burp Suite** (Proxy, Intruder, Grep Match/Extract)
- **Hydra** *(optional: requires explicit written permission)*

---

## Step-by-Step Exploitation

1. **Prepare & capture**
  - Open the target site with **Burp Proxy** on.
  - Click **Forgot password** and go through the normal flow for **your own account** so you can observe the traffic.

2. **Identify the reset request**
  - In **Proxy â†’ HTTP history**, find the password reset **submission** request ( POST like `/forgot-password`).
  - Confirm that a `temp-forgot-password-token` appears **both**:
    - In the **URL/query** (e.g., `.../reset?temp-forgot-password-token=abc123`)
    - In the **body** (e.g., `temp-forgot-password-token=abc123&username=youruser&new-password=...`)

3. **Send to Repeater**
  - Right-click the reset submission request â†’ **Send to Repeater**.

4. **Craft the malicious reset**
  - In **Repeater**, change:
    - `username=` from **your username** to the **victimâ€™s username** (e.g., `carlos`).
    - **Token tampering**: either **blank out** the token value in **both** places or make them **mismatched/empty**:
      - URL: `temp-forgot-password-token=`
      - Body: `temp-forgot-password-token=`
  - Set a **new password** you control in `new-password` (e.g., `NewPass!123`).
  
### ðŸ”Ž Burp Request â€” Before (example)
```http
POST /forgot-password?temp-forgot-password-token=abc123 HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-app.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=wiener&temp-forgot-password-token=abc123&new-password=MySecurePass1!
```
### ðŸ”Ž Burp Request â€” after (example)
```http
POST /forgot-password?temp-forgot-password-token= HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-app.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=carlos&temp-forgot-password-token=&new-password=NewPass!123
```


5. **Send the request**
  - Click **Send** in Repeater.

6. **Confirm success via response**
  - Look for **`302 Found`** (Location redirect) indicating the password was reset.
  - If using Burp, hit **Response** to view the landing page and messages.

7. **Verify by logging in as the victim**
- In the browser, log in using:
  - `username = victim` (e.g., `carlos`)
  - `password = NewPass!123` (the one you set)
- You should gain access to the victimâ€™s account page.

8. **Document impact**
  - State clearly: **anyone with a captured/blank token can reset arbitrary usersâ€™ passwords by changing `username`, due to        missing server-side binding between token and account**.

## Mitigation

1. **Bind reset tokens to specific accounts**  
   - Each password reset token must be generated uniquely per user and stored securely on the server side.  
   - The token should only be valid for the intended account and cannot be reused for other usernames.  

2. **Validate tokens strictly**  
   - The server should always validate the reset token against the correct user.  
   - Reject any request where the token is missing, blank, expired, or does not match the username.  

3. **Expire tokens quickly**  
   - Reset tokens should have short lifetimes (e.g., 10â€“15 minutes).  
   - Once used, they must be invalidated immediately.  

4. **Do not allow multiple reset parameters**  
   - The reset token should not appear in both URL and body.  
   - Keep it only in a secure channel (e.g., in the request body or as a signed link).  

5. **Rate limit reset attempts**  
   - Implement throttling to prevent brute-force or automated abuse of the reset functionality.  

6. **Audit and monitoring**  
   - Log all password reset requests and monitor for suspicious activity such as resets for multiple accounts from the same IP.

âœ… **Secure Implementation Example:**  
  - User requests reset â†’ Server generates random, cryptographically secure token â†’ Token stored against that user in DB â†’ Link sent via email â†’ On submission, server validates both the token *and* username match before allowing password change.

## Real-World Relevance

Broken password reset flows are a **common real-world vulnerability** because password reset functionality is present in almost every web application. If implemented incorrectly, attackers can reset passwords of other users without authorization.

### Examples in the wild:
  1. **TalkTalk (2016)** â€“ A broken password reset system allowed attackers to hijack accounts by manipulating reset tokens.  
  2. **GitHub (2014)** â€“ A flaw in GitHubâ€™s password reset logic could let attackers reuse reset tokens, potentially hijacking accounts.  
  3. **Many smaller SaaS platforms** â€“ Security researchers frequently report bugs where reset tokens are not properly validated against the intended user, allowing account takeover.  

### Why it matters:
  - Attackers can take over **critical accounts (admin, financial, healthcare, or cloud accounts)**.  
  - It leads to **identity theft, fraud, and data breaches**.  
  - Exploits often require **no user interaction beyond requesting a reset**, making them highly dangerous.  
  - Automated attacks can **reset thousands of accounts quickly** if proper controls are missing.
